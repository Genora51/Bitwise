A programming language that only uses binary operations.

## Bitwise in a nutshell

*Are you fed up with normal programming languages?*

*Are you sick of normal arithmetical operators?*

*Do you long for a programming language that takes 15 lines of code to add up 2 numbers?*
#### Then Bitwise is the language for you!

## Features

Bitwise consists of a few logical operators (`^`,`!`,`&`, etc.), some basic input/output, a few variables, and some control structures. And that's about it. Apart from input and output, all calculation must be done with binary. View the docs at [docs/main.md](docs/main.md).

## Running files

Running Bitwise files depends on whether you are using the python source version, or the compiled release.

### Release

The installer in the release gives the option to associate the `.bit` extension with bitwise.
However, if this option was not checked, if the portable version is being used,
or if you simply prefer the command line,
this command should be used:

    bitwise [filename.bit]

`[filename.bit]` should be replaced with the path or name of the bitwise program you wish to run.
If `bitwise` is not a recognised command, replace it with the path of `bitwise.exe`.

### Python Source

To run a bitwise file with python, use this command:

    python bitwise.py [filename.bit]

If not run from the bitwise folder, replace `bitwise.py` with the full (or relative path of the `bitwise.py` file).

Equally, if python is not in your `%PATH%` (i.e. not a valid command), replace `python` with the path of your `python.exe`.

`[filename.bit]` should be replaced with the path or name of the bitwise program you wish to run.
