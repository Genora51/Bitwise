# Bitwise
A programming language that only uses binary operations.

## Bitwise in a nutshell

*Are you fed up with normal programming languages?*

*Are you sick of normal arithmetical operators?*

*Do you long for a programming language that takes 15 lines of code to add up 2 numbers?*
#### Then Bitwise is the language for you!

## Features

Bitwise consists of a few logical operators (`^`,`!`,`&`, etc.), some basic input/output, a few variables, and some control structures. And that's about it. Apart from input and output, all calculation must be done with binary. View the docs at [docs/master](docs/master).
